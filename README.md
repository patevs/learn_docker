[`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of [platform as a service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) products that use [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) and therefore use fewer resources than [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).
